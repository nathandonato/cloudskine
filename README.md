## cloudskine is a daily journal app

I'm building this project because I want a minimalistic app where I can journal daily across all of my devices.

Also, it's a way for me to learn a few things:
* React.js / Redux
* Rails' API-only mode (my Rails experience was limited to Rails 4)
* Using JWTs for user authentication
